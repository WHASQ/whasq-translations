    are registered
    and protected trademarks. Any reproduction in part or in whole of the trademarks and/or logos present on the
    <strong>Site</strong> and the <strong>Application</strong>, based on elements of the <strong>Site</strong> and the

    in part or in whole as well as any qualitative or quantitative substantial extraction towards another
    <strong>Site</strong> or <strong>application</strong> is prohibited and punishable under section L. 343-4 and the

    reproduce, adapt or decompile the <strong>Application</strong>. The <strong>Clic and Walk</strong> <strong>Application</strong>

    harm. Concerning this authorization, <strong>Clic and Walk</strong> reserves the right of opposition. <strong>Clic
        and Walk</strong> cannot be held liable for any harm, direct, indirect or incidental caused as a result of
